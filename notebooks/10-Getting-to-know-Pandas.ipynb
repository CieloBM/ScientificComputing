    "# What is Pandas?\n",
    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the Python Data Analysis Library (a.k.a. Pandas). The Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with matplotlib and integrates nicely with other libraries that use NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like `NumPy`, Pandas introduces some new data types to our Python world, the most important of which is the **DataFrame**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, a DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different types (including characters, integers, floating point values, factors and more) in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or an SQL table or the data.frame in R. A DataFrame always has an index (0-based). An index refers to the position of an element in the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we load our data into a DataFrame, pandas gives a host of analytical capabilities with the data. Among these are:\n",
    "  - subset/select/query specific rows and or columns of data\n",
    "  - handling missing data\n",
    "  - grouping/aggregating data\n",
    "  - sorting, transforming, pivoting, and \"melting\" data\n",
    "  - computing descriptive and summary stats\n",
    "  - combining data in different DataFrames \n",
    "  - plotting data\n",
    "  \n",
    "In short, Pandas and its DataFrame object is essentially a one-stop for anything data."
